# Python Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Python Projects Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of my Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and data analysis projects. Each folder represents a different activity, exercise, or project, demonstrating my proficiency in Python programming and related technologies.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

### 1. **Data Analysis & Manipulation**
- Utilized libraries such as `pandas` and `numpy` for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- Processed real-world datasets (e.g., AirQualityUCI.csv, autoscout24-germany-dataset.csv).
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generated statistical summaries.

### 2. **Data Visualization**
- Created insightful visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Developed plots and charts to communicate data trends and findings.

### 3. **Scripting & Automation**
- Wrote reusable Python scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
- Implemented file I/O operations for reading and writing data.

### 4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Designed and implemented classes and objects to structure code efficiently.
- Applied OOP principles for modularity and code reuse.

### 5. **Problem Solving & Algorithms**
- Developed algorithms to solve various computational problems.
- Applied logical thinking and Python's control structures (loops, conditionals, functions).

### 6. **Jupyter Notebooks**
- Documented code and analysis in Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration.
- Combined code, visualizations, and markdown explanations for clear presentation.

### 7. **Project Organization**
- Structured projects into logical folders and modules for maintainability.
- Used clear naming conventions and modular code design.

## Project Structure

- **code/**: General Python scripts and utilities.
- **DeVeraMidterm/**: Midterm project files.
- **Laboratory Activity #01-05/**: Lab exercises and activities, each with its own main script or notebook.
- **pythonProject/**: Data analysis projects and datasets.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the desired project folder.
3. Run the Python scripts using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   or open Jupyter notebooks with:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
